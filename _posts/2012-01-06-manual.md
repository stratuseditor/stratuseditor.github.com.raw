  * [Plugins](/plugins) in JavaScript or CoffeeScript
  * Configurable width tabs
  * Variable-width font support
  * **All in your web browser**


## Browser Support
Currently supported browsers:

  * Google Chrome
  * Chromium

It will probably work in Safari also, but it has not tested
(let me know if you try it!).

## Server Installation
Regardless of Node.js' support for Windows, the Stratus server
requires a Unix-like OS to run such as Linux or Mac OS.

  1. [Install Node.js and NPM](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)
  
  2. Get the server
  
         # Get the bundle manager.
         $ npm install stratus-bundle -g
         
         # Install the default bundles.
         # (this might take a while)
         $ stratus-bundle setup
         ...
         
         # Install the editor server.
         $ npm install stratus -g
  
  3. Start the server
     
         $ stratus start
     
     Point your browser to the address it prints and start coding!


## Server Config

  * `--pass <a password>`: Require the user to input a password with
    HTTP basic authentication before they can use the editor.
    The username is _stratus_.
  * `--port <port>`: Set the port that Stratus is running on.
  * `--local`: Only allow access locally. This will null the password.
  * `--version`: Print the version.
  * `--help`: Print the options.


# File Manager

Files can be opened via the file manager by clicking on the file
in the tree or the built-in _Snap Open_ plugin.

## Snap Open
To activate _Snap Open_, press `Ctrl-o`. Files will be filtered
using a fuzzy search. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the list.

To open a file, press enter to open the file or click the list item.
Control-clicking a list item opens it without closing the dialog.

## Keyboard Navigation

Click a file in the tree to enter the file tree scope.

  * `Up/Down`      - Navigate among visible leaves.
  * `Left`         - Collapse expandable leaf.
  * `Right`        - Expand expandable leaf.
  * `Home/end`     - Navigate to first or last visible leaf.
  * `Page up/down` - Navigate to the first or last sibling of the current leaf.
  * `Enter`        - Equivalent to clicking the leaf.
  * `Tab`          - Navigate to the next expandable leaf.
  * `Shift-Tab`    - Navigate to the previous expandable leaf.

# Text Navigation
## Home-Home
Pressing `Home` when at the beginning of a line will place the cursor
just before the first non-whitespace character in the line.

# Text Manipulation
## Line Manipulation
### Indent / Outdent
To indent several lines, select them and press `Tab`. To outdent
one or more lines, select them and type `Shift-Tab`.

### Moving Lines
Selected line(s) can be shifted up or down by selecting them and pressing
`Alt-Up` or `Alt-Down`.

### Deleting Lines
To delete the selected lines, press `Ctrl-d`.

## Auto Pairing
When an open pair character is typed, the corresponding closing
character will be automatically inserted into the text. The
pairs for which this applies are (by default):

    ()  {}  []  ""  ''

In addition to automatic character insertion, selecting a body
of text and then typing one of the open characters will
wrap the selected text.

The characters that are paired can be customized by bundle. For example,
in HTML `<>` will also complete.

## Autocomplete
Autocomplete is activated with `Escape` by default. The words used to
complete are drawn from the current bundle's `completions.txt` file,
and also from words within the current file.

## Search & Replace
The search & replace dialog (`Control-f` by default) behaves as you would
expect.

**RegExp captures** - When the _Regular expression_ check box is checked,
the _Replace with_ term has access to the captures of the _Search for_
term using `$0`, `$1`, ...


# Bundles
See [Bundles](/bundles)
for information about bundles.

# Themes
Editor themes are JSON files. See
[Idlefingers](https://github.com/stratuseditor/stratus-color/blob/master/themes/Idlefingers.json)
for an example theme.

Set the theme with the [fractus.theme](/config#fractus.theme) configuration.

Note that the `token`s used in `"syntax"` are not inclusive. Adding `foo`
would do nothing, however, unless a syntax language is configured to
highlight text using it.

## Built-in Themes

  * [Idlefingers](http://idlefingers.co.uk/) _(default)_
  * [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * [Solarized-Light](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
  * [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installing Themes

Additional theme files can be placed in your `~/.stratus/themes` directory.


# Project Management
Projects are stored in
`$HOME/.stratus/development/projects/:username/:projectname`.

## Link

If you want to create a project that points to a different
location on your file system than the default, create the project normally.
Then,

    $ stratus link username/projectname new/path/to/project/root

## Show

Print the project's path.

    $ stratus show username/projectname
    path/to/username/projectname


# Split Screen
Horizontal and vertical splits are available under the `View` menu.
